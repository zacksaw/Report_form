# Report_form

This is a PDF form made for a large clinical trial office in Manhattan to report serious adverse events to the FDA and pharmacetical companies. The form uses Adobe JavaScript conditional logic to lock/unlock fields to ensure the form is completed properly. It also reminds users of the definitions of harmful, related, and unexpected per FDA guidelines so they properly select the urgency of the report. 

The form also drafts an email with a subject and body that reflects the form's contents. This ensures proper handoff of the report to other departments within the clinical trials office.
